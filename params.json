All these programs have one big problem they are simply a digital representation of the character sheet and not a tool to truly enhance the game. Instead Gamer Tools tries to add not only an Interactive Sheet that improves the game but adding other tools to help Dungeon Masters and players enhance the game all around. Such as chat, a battle tool, a dungeon tool, a character creation wizard, and other modules to help enhance gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Implemented Modules\r\n## Inprogress Modules\r\n#### Chararcter Create\r\n## Ond Day Modules\r\n##### Chat\r\n##### Battle\r\n##### DM Tools\r\n##### Interactive Sheet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
